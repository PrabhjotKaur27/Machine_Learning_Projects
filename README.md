During my studies in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Winnipeg, I engaged in the development of ML and AI models, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), executed extract, transform, load (ETL) processes, and performed comprehensive data analysis. This portfolio contains all my projects.
